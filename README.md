# BookSearch

## Description
Aa a former librarian at USC, I would like to search for new books to read so I can keep a list of books I would like to purchase.
This project is a book searching engine. 

WHEN I load the search engine

THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option

THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button

WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button

THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site

WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option

THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up

WHEN the toggle is set to Signup

THEN I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button

WHEN the toggle is set to Login

THEN I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button

WHEN I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button

THEN my user account is created and I am logged in to the site

WHEN I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button

THEN I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site

WHEN I am logged in to the site

THEN the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see my saved books, and Logout

WHEN I am logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button

THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account

WHEN I click on the Save button on a book

THEN that book’s information is saved to my account

WHEN I click on the option to see my saved books

THEN I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account

WHEN I click on the Remove button on a book

THEN that book is deleted from my saved books list

WHEN I click on the Logout button

THEN I am logged out of the site and presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
